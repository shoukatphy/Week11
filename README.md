## Central Limit Theorem 
[The central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) states that the average of the random numbers generated through a probability distribution function tends to give a standard normal distribution. <bar>
I have written a simple code  to explain the central limit theorem. It shows that when the number of experiments are increased the width of the histogram  dI have written a simple code to explain the central limit theorem. It shows that when the number of experiments are increased the width of the histogram plotted by filling the average of the random number decreases. 
## How to Run the Program?
  In order to run this program, one needs to pass two integers as an argument of the function. The first integer will be equal the number of the samples in a single experiment and the second will be the total number of experiments carried out. I have plotted for 2000 samples and 200 experiments. 
The program can be run using root macro. Go to the [ROOT](https://root.cern/) terminal root[0] and use the command  **`.x CenLimitTheo.C(2000, 200)`** .
